# blackhole_earth
 What if the Earth collapses to a black hole, instantaneously?

## This was written to learn about JupyterLab and related technologies.
This was for fun, and was inspired by a podcast scenario:
> Youâ€™re standing on the Earth equator, when it suddenly collapses to a black hole.
> Do you fall into the resulting black hole, the size of a peanut?

## Notes
- The Makefile is for generating the PDF output automagically.
- I use the "direnv" package for a local Python3 env.
- The needed packages can be loaded using "requirements.in" via pip3.

## Todo
- gh-pages or similar
- google-colab link
- update for a likely limit to black hole angular momentum
